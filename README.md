Hi, please read the following text to better understand the maze program.



# SECTION 1: Maze structure


For making your own maze file, set up a .txt

Then, set up your .txt as follows:

WIDTH
HEIGHT
...
MAZE (separated by spaces and visually 1s are walls and 0s are pathways)
...

- MAKE SURE THE FIRST AND LAST ROW ARE ALL FULL OF 1s AS WELL AS THE FIRST AND LAST COLUMN OF EVERY ROW -
The program is going to assume your first 0 and last 0 are the start and end.

___________________________
Here is an example of a maze file.txt:

4 # Width of maze <br>
6 # Height of maze <br>
1 1 1 1 # First row is full of 1s <br> 
1 0 1 1 # First and last column are all 1s <br> 
1 0 0 1 <br>
1 0 1 1 <br>
1 0 1 1 <br>
1 1 1 1 # Last row is full of 1s <br>

__________________________

As you can see, it can be very easy to set up a maze as it is very visually accessible to create one with 1s representing walls and 0s representing pathways.




# SECTION 2: Installing pygame

This program utilizes pygame for input and rendering purposes. 

___________________________
You can install pygame by inputting the following in your console:

> pip install pygame
___________________________

Make sure you have python3 installed. Otherwise the pip command is not going to work.




# SECTION 3: Personilization

Make sure to change the following files for better personification.

___________________________
To change the character:

Replace character.png with one of your choice
___________________________

To change the walls:

Replace wall.png with one of your choice

# Tasks
- Implement the stack data structure using a linked list: DONE (see code)

- Implement the stack data structure using a partially-filled array: DONE (see code)

- Handle all the appropriate exception situations, such as a) undoing too many moves
(cannot return past the start of the maze), and b) pushing onto a full stack (not enough
bread crumbs to go forward!): DONE (Will see when playing the game)

- Create three images: one that represents a straight corridor, one that represents a left turn,
and one for a right turn. When the user chooses to go home, display on a window each of
these according to the appropriate path. DONE (Game itself is visual)

- Design an input file that describes some kind of simple maze. At any point in the maze,
limit the userâ€™s options (forward, right, left) according to what the maze allows. DONE (Read above)

- In conjunction with the previous two, add some images: one for a dead end, one for a T-
junction, one for an intersection, and one that represents the goal (such as finding a
treasure). Set up the program to only show the choice ahead of the user according to the
maze you have created. DONE (Game itself is visual with limited view of player)
